GENERAL TERMS&#10;&#10;14.1 The Terms constitute the entire agreement between You and Flexera Software relating to their subject matter, and cancel and supersede any prior versions of the Terms. No modification to the Terms will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized Flexera Software representative. You must not assign or otherwise transfer the Terms or any right granted hereunder. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when You use Flexera Software or third-party products or services.&#10;&#10;14.2 You agree that any material breach of Sections 2, 3, 4, 6, and 10 of the Terms will result in irreparable harm to Flexera Software for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and, therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, Flexera Software will be entitled to equitable relief, including both a preliminary and permanent injunction, if such a breach occurs. You waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security if Flexera Software seeks such an injunction.&#10;&#10;14.3 California law and controlling U.S. federal law govern any action related to the Terms and/or Your use of the Website. Choice of law rules of any jurisdiction and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to any dispute under the Terms. You and Flexera Software agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California, U.S.A.&#10;&#10;14.4 Services, Content, and product derived or obtained from this Website may be subject to the U.S. export laws and the export or import laws of other countries.

Such forward-looking statements may include statements regarding market expectations and opportunities, expectations about financials, research and development and strategies, statements concerning Flexera Software's roadmaps, market share growth, and product and service development and introduction, and our continuous evaluation of the competitiveness of our product and service offerings. These forward-looking statements are just predictions and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such a difference include risks related to adverse changes in general economic conditions, failure to reduce costs, lack of success in technical advancements, the timely development, production and acceptance of new products and services, and Flexera Software's ability to compete in a rapidly changing marketplace.&#10;&#10;14.7 Any express waiver or failure to exercise promptly any right under the Terms will not create a continuing waiver or any expectation of non-enforcement. If any provision of the Terms is held invalid by any law or regulation of any government, or by any court or arbitrator, the parties agree that such provision will be replaced with a new provision that accomplishes the original business purpose, and the other provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect" />
